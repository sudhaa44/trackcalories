# Health-Tracker

Health-Tracker (scaffolded using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)'s [backbone generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone)) was developed to showcase my understanding of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and handling of API requests. It's an optional project of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [Front End Web Devloper Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Overview

This web app tracks the foods you eat throughout the day, keeping score on calories, proteins, carbs and fats. It features a searchable directory powered by [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/), so no matter how sinful or healthy your cravings are you can track them!
